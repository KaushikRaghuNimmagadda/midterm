# Goal and Context
You have been hired as an electrical engineer at a new energy non-profit focused on using [vehicle-to-grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle-to-grid) systems for energy storage. The company hopes that developing an open-source vehicle-to-grid solution might encourage local energy companies to subsidize electric vehicles, especially as a means to offset natural variations in renewable generation (e.g. solar, tidal, wind). Of course, there will be many economic, political, and social constraints that will determine whether this path is viable. However, as an engineer, you are excited by the challenge of creating such a solution yourself... 

Building on your ENGN1931Z experience, you divide to prototype the essential components using: (1) Google Apps Script to log data, (2) On-Board Diagnostic commands to query vehicle information, and (3) Web APIs to query local energy pricing. The following questions will lead you through several design challenges that you may encounter along the way.
