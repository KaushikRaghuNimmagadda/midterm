# Goal and Context
You've been hired as an engineer at a new non-profit organization focused on promoting clean energy technology. Your first project is to develop an open-source [vehicle-to-grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle-to-grid) system that can encourage local energy companies to subsidize electric vehicles, especially as a means to offset natural [intermittency of renewable energy sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_energy_source) (e.g., solar, tidal, wind). Of course, there will be many economic, political, and social constraints that will determine whether this path is viable. However, as an engineer, you are excited by the challenge of creating such a solution yourself.... 

Building on your ENGN1931Z experience, you decide to prototype the essential components using three main components: (1) Google Apps Script to log data, (2) On-Board Diagnostic CAN Bus commands to query vehicle information, and (3) Web APIs and Web Scraping to query local energy pricing and sources. The following questions will lead you through several design challenges that you may encounter along the way.
